This will be my first excursion, my first jaunt, my first expedition into
blogging. I will go where no man has dared to go before, into the fray, the 
frenzy, the fire.

This website is built on Jekyll, a static webpage generator. The theme is a 
minimalist one called Pixyll, and the website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I can do things like highlight code:

{% highlight CSS %}
	.BigDivs {
	color: truckingBlue;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I can also list things:

	*Apples
	*Oranges

Have Headers...

Of course, I can have lovely images.
