This is my second post, I'm still not sure if I want to blog yet but it could be a major stress
release for me. I'll be taking this end of the year post to reminisce about the year. Maybe I'll 
also become a better writer and improve my grammar, **whom is** knows? Let me break it down.

1. Chemistry

   An interesting start to a mundane day. The significant part about this class is it's the one before Pre-Eng.

2. Introduction to Engineering

   Grief, so much Grief. The only class I dipped to a B at the quarter in.

3. English

   The room smelled bad.

4. Debate

   Stress but fun.

5. Chinese

   Essientially a blow-off class.

6. Algebra 2
